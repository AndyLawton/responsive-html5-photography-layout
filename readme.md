# HTML5 Boilerplate Responsive Photography Layout

One and two column responsive layout focused on visual imagery.

The main goal was to try to make a template that would look good with landscape
and horizontal pictures across all devices.

There's no difference in the way images are served yet but that's something I'm looking into.
I would love any tips, suggestions and to hear how you handle images if you find my code here.

I built this using the html5 Boilerplate framework and have left it completely as is.

I really recommend reading up on it.  It has a great story and a lot of extremely 
talented developers make the template freely available. It's awesome.
